**Credit Risk Classification Analysis**

Analysis Purpose: we trained and evaluated a Logistic Regression Model on historical lending activity data from peer-to-peer lending service companies to classify loan candidates as either Healthy or High-Risk.

Results:
The model achieved an 99% overall accuracy.
It demonstrated precision and recall (100%) for Healthy loan candidates.
For High-Risk candidates, the model showed 87% precision and 89% recall.
The balanced accuracy score, averaging the F1 scores from both classes, reached 94%.
The confusion matrix indicated 18,679 True Negatives, 80 False Positives, 67 False Negatives, and 558 True Positives.


Summary: Overall I think the logistic regression model does a great job of classifying these loan candidates.
